# explosive-percolation-for-random-lattice
This a part of my Physics MS thesis at the University of Dhaka. Here I generate random lattice and perform explosive percolation.

## Conclusion
Didn't find any phase transition. This confirms that the random 2D lattice is not self-similar and doesn't follow dynamic scaling.
